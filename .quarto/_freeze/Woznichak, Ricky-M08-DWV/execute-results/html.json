This metric is localized, meaning it reflects search frequency within a chosen geographic database (e.g., United States, United Kingdom), and helps marketers understand the popularity and seasonal trends of a keyword. It’s a key indicator for estimating potential traffic and gauging keyword demand when planning SEO or PPC strategies.\n\n## **Keyword Difficulty**\n\nKeyword Difficulty is a metric developed by SEMrush to estimate how challenging it would be to rank organically in the top 10 search results on Google for a given keyword. It considers multiple factors such as the authority and backlink profiles of the current top-ranking pages, the competitiveness of the niche, and the overall strength of domains already ranking. The score is expressed as a percentage from 0 to 100 — with higher values indicating more competition and a greater need for robust SEO efforts, including high-quality content and backlinks, to achieve visibility.\n\n# Prospective Keyword Target Lists\n\n## Top 25 Keywords by Search Volume and Keyword Difficulty\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Woznichak,-Ricky-M08-DWV_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## PM Software Keywords by Search Volume and Keyword Difficulty\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Woznichak,-Ricky-M08-DWV_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Product Manager Keywords by Search Volume and Difficulty\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Woznichak,-Ricky-M08-DWV_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# Experiment:\n\n> Our goal is to utilize low competition, high value keywords within website content and monitor changes in search ranking for our targeted keywords.
